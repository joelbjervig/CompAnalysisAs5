Dear all,

Here is the 2020 competition. Have you heard about CAPTCHAs? Maybe not. But you have seen them all over the internet for sure. Google CAPTCHA to learn more. Your task is to make a function called my_classifier.m that decodes three digits in an image. You have plenty of training data in imagedata/ and in labels.txt you have the ground truth decoding.

Your solution should be programmed reasonably well so it terminates within 5 minutes on the training data set. We will run your function my_classifier.m on our own data, which is similar but not identical to your training data. If you score above 40% average precision and fulfill the time condition,  you pass the lab. See the enclosed script evaluate_classifier.m and the example my_classifier.m for an explanation of the expected formats. You are not allowed to use the built-in ocr function in Matlab in your solution.

Please upload your solution (the .m-file(s)) to Studium. It should at least include your own 'my_classifier.m' function, your own estimate of its average
precision, the execution time of the method, and your own cool team name. It is enough to put the metrics as a comment in your script or on Studium. No report required.

We will later announce the winner (and award a small prize :) )  based on the average precision score!

P.S.
You are allowed to use Deep Learning, for instance, MATLAB's Deep Learning Toolbox, Tensorflow/Keras, or Pytorch. If you choose a Python based deep learning framework, we strongly recommend that you submit your solution as a link to a Google Colab notebook (colab.research.google.com). This allows us to run your code without having to deal with different libraries and dependencies.
